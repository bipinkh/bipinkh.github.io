This whiteboarding application allows multiple users to collaborate on one session at realtime. All the protocols including session setup, message transfer, connection setup, rooom handling, synchronization and SSL security is developed from scracth. This project is a part of the masters course (ELEC-E7320 - Internet Protocols) at Aalto University.  

We mainly focused on the implementation of the protocol as a PoC. The security of the application was out of the scope.
